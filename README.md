# **University Success Analysis**

üîç The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of global university rankings using a rich dataset that includes information about universities, ranking systems, criteria, and historical performance metrics. By leveraging this dataset, we seek to gain insights into the factors influencing university rankings, track the evolution of universities' standings over time, and discern patterns in the global higher education landscape.

Problem Statement
- Compare university rankings across different systems, assess the impact of ranking criteria on university positions, and analyze changes in university metrics over time. Utilize SQL and Excel for data aggregation and for EDA. Create a Power BI dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of university rankings.

Dataset Description
